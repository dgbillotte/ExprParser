# ExprParserWriter

ExprParserWriter is a parser / re-writer for the C-like expressions that are
used in the expr/expr~ objects of the PureData programming language.

Its intended purpose is for the continued development of the [Heavy/HVCC
PureData compiler (my fork)](https://github.com/dgbillotte/hvcc) which will
turn a valid Pd patch into executable C-code. Below is an example of a
simple expression and the resulting nested C-code that gets generated from
it.

```c
// input expression
sin($f1 + 2) / sqrt($f2)

// generated nested C-code
__hv_div_f(__hv_sin_f(__hv_add_f($f1, 2)), __hv_sqrt_f($f2));

// generated sequential SIMD ready C-code
__hv_add_f($f1, 2, BO0);
__hv_sin_f(BO0, BO1);
__hv_sqrt_f($f2, BO0);
__hv_div_f(BO1, BO0, BO2);
```

Pd provides two versions of expr: `[expr]` and `[expr~]` where the `~`
indicates that the object runs at "signal rate". Objects without the `~`
are run at control rate which is a couple orders of magnitude slower.

Because of this difference in needed execution speed, the audio-rate objects
rely on heavily optimized code to ensure that they can run at full speed without
buffer underflows. This is a case where it can never be fast enough because
further improvements will always allow a user to do more with a given piece of
hardware. It should be noted that smaller ARM Î¼-controllers are a common target
for HVCC generated code, so being precious with resources is a requirement.

The existing HVCC infrastructure provides wrappers for most of the native C
operators and functions from `math.h` of the form `__hv_FUNC_f()`, for example:
`__hv_add_f(a,b,out)` or `__hv_sin_f(a, out)`. They are designed this way to
facilitate compiling for different SIMD instruction sets, namely: AVX and SSE
for the x86 architecture and NEON for ARM. If none of these SIMD optimizations
are applied the code falls back to the native C function calls.
